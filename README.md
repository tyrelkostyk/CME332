Lab Work from CME332: Real Time Computing

Included in this repo is all of the course work from my CME 332 (Real-Time Computing) Labs.

Initial labs (1-2) were written in basic C, to interface with an Altera DE2-115 FPGA board.

Subsequent labs (3-5) were written in C utilizing the uC/OS-II RTOS Library. These were then uploaded onto the FPGA which was programmed to behave like a NIOS-II processer (soft CPU uploaded onto the FPGA)
